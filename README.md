# Four Class Gaussian Experiments

Implement computing mean/covariance of a MultiVariable Gaussian
over an empirical dataset.

Implement eigendecomposition based on covariance matrix for each class.

Plot classes with first principal component.

# Mahalanobis Distance

1a. Implement mahalanobis between two vectors under a given covariance matrix.
(vector 2 could be mean or other sample)

1b. Implement a discrimintant function with mahal-distance function.
